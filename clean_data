First we will use this repository to learn how to clean data for analysis and SQL measures.

We're now looking at the factbook CSV 

we notice the data is not parsed into columns but there is a delimiter that we can see

for example we see this in row 1 
Country;Area(sq km);Birth rate(births/1000 population);Current account balance;Death rate(deaths/1000 population);Debt - external;Electricity - consumption(kWh);Electricity - production(kWh);Exports;GDP;GDP - per capita;GDP - real growth rate(%);HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate(%);HIV/AIDS - deaths;HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS;Highways(km);Imports;Industrial production growth rate(%);Infant mortality rate(deaths/1000 live births);Inflation rate (consumer prices)(%);Internet hosts;Internet users;Investment (gross fixed)(% of GDP);Labor force;Life expectancy at birth(years);Military expenditures - dollar figure;Military expenditures - percent of GDP(%);Natural gas - consumption(cu m);Natural gas - exports(cu m);Natural gas - imports(cu m);Natural gas - production(cu m);Natural gas - proved reserves(cu m);Oil - consumption(bbl/day);Oil - exports(bbl/day);Oil - imports(bbl/day);Oil - production(bbl/day);Oil - proved reserves(bbl);Population;Public debt(% of GDP);Railways(km);Reserves of foreign exchange & gold;Telephones - main lines in use;Telephones - mobile cellular;Total fertility rate(children born/woman);Unemployment rate(%)

a long string of what we know will be the column types. 

we can see the capitalization in the string "Country ; Area" which tells us what the data is 
holding as 'lists of variables' then set in the columns. 

Country = will be a String of characters 'string' type of data  

Area = double (Float is a datatype, representing a fractional in decimal point) 


 we see this continues on in the first row so lets go on to the second row 
 
 String;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double;double
 
 The datatypes of the corresponding columns
we know basic syntax of math already explained 

Row 4 begins with the first beauty of missing information 

Akrotiri;123;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Akrotiri is the name of an ancient Greek city
not surprising this ancient city does not have modern records of electricity consumption 


what happens if we remove an outlier? How will removing 
a bottom impact value affect the median & mean?

Mean = Average 
Medium = Middle Number 
Mode = Most Frequent Number 

According to Khan Academy "Both the mean and the median will increase, 
but the mean will increase by more than the median."

how will we handle empty values in the set?

Empty cells can potentially give you a wrong result when you analyze data.

In Python package "Pandas" we have the dropna()
method which returns a new DataFrame with NO EMPTY CELLS,
and will not change the original.

ejemplo:
##we import the package as name as varable pd
import pandas as pd
#naming a variable df and equating it to pandas variable pd and method "read_csv" then the 
#data.csv filename
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
#we name a new variable "new_df" and add in the "dropna" method
new_df = df.dropna()
#printing results 
print(new_df.to_string())

NO EMPTY CELLS IS DIFFERENT FROM NULL 

This is dependent upon the equation and what we are looking for it is important to recognize how this will affect the data
